# Conways
Conway's Game of Life implementation
Initially, click on the cells to toggle them alive or dead for the initial pattern, and press space to start the Game of Life.
You can press Return at any time to interrupt the Game of Life and reset it. 
Whenever a final state is reached (no change between two consecutive generations), the user is notified and the Game is reset.
